/// Floors ghost-text size to the smallest caret line height observed during one focus session.
///
/// AX caret geometry is eventually consistent and app-specific. The same field can yield a tight
/// line-height caret on one poll (zero-length `BoundsForRange`) and the full field-height `AXFrame`
/// fallback on the next, when the precise branches happen to fail. Because `OverlayController`
/// derives ghost font size from caret height, that fluctuation renders the suggestion comically
/// oversized whenever the coarse fallback wins a poll.
///
/// When a reading is imprecise we treat the smallest height seen this session as the truth and
/// clamp larger readings down to it. The baseline is keyed by `FocusTracker`'s
/// `focusChangeSequence`, so switching fields — or leaving and re-entering the same field — starts
/// a fresh measurement instead of inheriting a stale ceiling.
///
/// This intentionally biases toward the smaller reading: an over-tall fallback is the observed
/// failure mode, and the user's "Smallest Ghost Text" floor downstream bounds how small a spurious
/// low reading can make the text.
///
/// Crucially, the clamp applies *only to imprecise readings*. The flicker it defends against is
/// specifically a precise branch failing and falling back to the coarse `AXFrame` height, which is
/// reported as `.estimated`. A precise measurement (`.exact` / `.derived`) is a real line box and
/// must be honoured immediately, because the host's text can legitimately grow within one focus
/// session — changing the font size or the zoom level does exactly that without ever changing the
/// focused element. Clamping those readings made the session minimum a ratchet: a user who set
/// Word to 20pt after typing at 12pt kept a caret pinned at the old 17pt height, and ghost text
/// stayed 40% too small until focus happened to change.
