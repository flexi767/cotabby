/// File overview:
/// Renders the prompt for Cotabby's base-model completion pipeline (the Open Source / llama path).
///
/// Design: a *base* model has no instruction-following channel and will happily continue a bare
/// "Task:" line as if it were the document, so an instruction-blob prompt would leak scaffolding into
/// the ghost text. This renderer treats the model as a pure text continuer: persona, style, language,
/// and supporting context are folded into a short conditioning preface (a base model conditions on
/// description, it does not obey commands), and the caret prefix is the LAST thing in the prompt with
/// trailing whitespace trimmed so generation begins at a clean word boundary.
///
/// Sections are character-budgeted via `PromptSectionBudget` so a large glossary, clipboard, or
/// screen capture can never crowd out the caret text: the prefix gets top priority and a guaranteed
/// minimum, and context fills the remaining budget by priority.
